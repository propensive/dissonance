Quagmire implements Eugene Myers' diff algorithm in Scala as an immutable function. Using it is as
simple as calling `Diff.diff(left, right)`, where `left` and `right` are sequences of like-typed
data to be comparied; the result is an instance of `Diff`, a sequence of additions, deletions and
no-change nodes representing each item in the left and right sequence.
