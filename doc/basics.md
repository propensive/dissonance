Dissonance provides only a single method, `diff`, which takes a `left` and
`right` parameter, both sequences of the same type, and generates a sequence of
the edits required to transform the left sequence into the right sequence, a
result of type `Diff`. Each element of the resultant sequence is either a `Par`
value (for _parity_), corresponding to a value in both the left and right
sequences, an `Ins` value (for _insertions_) which exists only in the right
sequence, or a `Del` value (for _deletions_) which exists only in the left
sequence.

The naming of these enumeration cases corresponds to a translation of the left
sequence into the right sequence, but could describe a translation from the
right sequence to the left if the roles are reversed. The `Diff#flip` method
can automatically reverse the translation.

Each of the three possible `Edit` cases, `Ins`, `Del` and `Par` includes the
relevant value, as well as the indices of that value in each sequence it exists
in: for `Ins`, the right; for `Del`, the left, and for `Par` both a `left` and
`right` index.

### Custom equality

By default, elements of the left and right sequences will be considered _the
same_ (producing `Par` values) if they are equal according to Java's universal
equality method, `AnyRef#equals`. However, other forms of equality (or
similarity) may exist, and it may be useful to consider two elements to be _the
same_, even if they are not equal according to `AnyRef#equals`. A common example
would be if they had the same ID, even if their content is different.

The `diff` method takes an optional third parameter, `compare`, of type
`(ElemType, ElemType) -> Boolean` which determines whether two elements are
_the same_ for the purposes of the diff.

### Collation

Given a `Diff` instance, created from two sequences, its `collate` method can be
used to group subsequences of changes together into changed and unchanged
regions. For any given _diff_ result, this collation can be done unambiguously:
runs of adjacent `Par`s are grouped together into an `Unchanged` instance, and
between each run will be one or more `Ins` and/or `Del` values which are grouped
into a `Changed` instance, consisting of a sequence of deletions and a sequence of
insertions.

Conventionally, the diff algorithm will output deletions before insertions, but in
terms of correctness, the order in which deletions and insertions are applied does
not matter. The result of collation will always be an alternating sequence of
`Changed` and `Unchanged` sections.

### Deeper Diff

`Diff` also provides a method, `rdiff`, which will use these collated changes and
perform a further diff on each changed section which contains at least one insertion
and at least one deletion, since some of these may be more usefully viewed as
_substitutions_ or replacements, rather than unrelated insertions and deletions. The
`rdiff` method requires a _similarity_ function, `(ElemType, ElemType) -> Boolean`,
which can identify values in the left and right sequences which are similar (but
which have already been identified as non-equal). These are thus presented as `Sub`
nodes.

Since the order in which each deletion or insertion is applied within a changed
section does not affect correctness, each nested diff may decide to identify certain
insertion/deletion pairs as "substitutes" and fit the remaining insertions and
deletions around them.

The result is an instance of `RDiff` containing a (now flattened) sequence of
`Ins`s, `Del`s, `Par`s and `Sub`s. Note that all but `Sub` have the supertype,
`Edit`, while all have the supertype, `Change`.

Furthermore, `rdiff` has a second, optional, parameter, `subSize`, which may be used
to automatically convert short, changed sections with an equal number of insertions
and deletions, into a sequence of `Sub`s, provided they are less than `subSize`. The
value defualts to `1`. So, as isolated insertion/deletion region of length `subSize`
would become a series of `Sub`s, regardless of whether the similarity function returns
`true` or `false`.

### Applying a Diff

A `Diff` instance, say `diff`,  may be applied to a sequence, `seq`, with,
```scala
diff.patch(seq)
```
to produce a new sequence. This is performed lazily, so the result is a `LazyList`.

By default, a `Par` "edit" will leave the element in the original sequence unchanged.
However, `patch` has an optional second parameter, `update`, which can be provided
to specify how `Par` edits should be handled. Of course, if the edit is a `Par`, the
original and diff versions of element _should_ be equal anyway, but may not be if,
for example, the diff was constructed with a different "compare" function or the
diff is being incorrectly applied to the wrong input.

Three reasonable alternatives for `update` are:
- to ignore the value in the diff, and keep the original (the default),
- to ignore the original value and replace it with the value in the diff
- to check that the original and diff elements are equal, and fail if they are not

But more involved possibilities are available which could "merge" the original and
diff elements, or prefer one or the other.
